## II. Preface:  
KillDDL is an Android project. It is an application that helps users organize their tasks with ease. We are making it an efficiency booster by allowing users to choose different frequencies of push notification reminder, set the pattern of repetition of a task, and select type and priority of a task. We are making this application simple and straightforward, so users can better focus on organizing their work and achieve more.


## III. Introduction:
We often have a headache when there are tons of work to do but we sadly find ourselves lost in a mess of tasks with different deadlines and priorities. Sometimes we managed to find the right thing to do after cleaning up the threads our mind. But more often, we suffer a lot because we miss a deadline, and eventually costs us even more to fix. As a result, many people tried using deadline management tools, but results tend to mix, either because users are overwhelmed by the complexity of the software, or because the software is incompetent in doing what the users expect. Here comes KillDDL, our deadline killer and efficiency booster. KillDDL empower the users in many ways. Apart from basic functions that a deadline management tool have, we also introduce some new features. For example, it allows users to choose varying frequencies of push notification reminder, so that the user can either set a single notification for an incoming due, or set a series of notifications each day before the due. User can also set the pattern of repetition of a task, so the user will be notified of recurring tasks, like monthly rent payments. Moreover, the user can select type and priority of a task so that the user can better focus on the things of a certain type or level of importance.

Similar applications in market includes Things, Wunderlist, Omnifocus, etc. These applications are good as testified by their popularity among users. Still, users often find themselves lost when they try to learn how to best utilize them; the cost of learning is often very high for those who just want to make use of a productivity tool. We believe that the lower cost of learning is important for better user experience. Also, we would like to help user focus on their tasks instead of managing and organizing them. So we are making this application to minimize the overhead of learning and provide users the most simple and straightforward experiences.
